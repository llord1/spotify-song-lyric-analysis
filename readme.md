# Exploring, Analyzing, and Modeling 58 years of Popular Music

## Introduction
#### A Reboot of a Prior Project
This analysis originated as a [group-based final project](https://github.com/manksh/EDAV_Dream_Team) for a course in my M.S. in Data Science program called [**STAT 5702: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/GR5702-20181-001/). In that project, we examined the lyrics and audio features of America's most popular songs from 1965-2015 to gain insights about how our culture and music industry has evolved. However, because the project was to be conducted primarily in R despite our much greater proficiency with Python, we were relatively hamstrung and had to limit the scope and depth of our explorations. After finishing the class and free to explore the data without constraints, I decided to revisit and extend the project in Python for a more comprehensive analysis.

#### Motivation

Popular music offers a unique lens through which to study what preoccupies a society, what people value in their entertainment, and how cultural preferences change with each generation. [**Billboard Magazine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)) publishes a yearly chart, the [**Year-End Hot 100**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End) that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States based on data collected from physical sales, digital sales, radio airplay, and streaming. Many text mining analyses have been performed on the lyrics of these songs, with [Kaylin Pavlik's](https://www.kaylinpavlik.com/50-years-of-pop-music/), whose dataset my group used in the original project, among the most notable. To build on these ideas, we also incorporated for each song audio-feature data (such as loudness, tempo, danceability, etc.) maintained by Spotify. The combination of data from the Billboard rankings, song lyrics, and Spotify provides many avenues for rich and interesting analysis.
